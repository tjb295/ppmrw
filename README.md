####USAGE#####
To use this program you must enter 3 command line arguments
The first must be either 3 or 6, specifying the target file to either be P3(ascii) or P6(raw bit)

Following this you must enter your input file name to be converted, this can either be a p3 or p6 file

The final argument is the name of the outputfile to be written to, preferrablly the file does not exist yet

###known issues####
Will seg fault if you attempt to write to an output file that is being open by another program, not sure how to watch out for this.
Also I'm being completely honest and not trying to weasel out of the points for commits, but I had over 40 commits from the past 2 weeks
and today I used a git reset and another slew of commands because my git was not letting me push and somehow it erased all of my commits
but I understand that the commits you see is all you know.
